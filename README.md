# nerdctl-install

Script that automates installing latest version of nerdctl, containerd and runc.

`!Incompatible with docker!` - It overwites runc and containerd so stuff might break, will try and fix this in the future if possible.

Tested on debian

## Usage:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ruedoux/nerdctl-install.git
sh nerdctl-install/get-nerdctl.sh
```
